      <p class="mb-4">In today's world of rapidly evolving AI applications, having access to OpenAI's API can be a game-changer. Whether you’re looking to integrate AI features similar to ChatGPT into your application or simply experiment with powerful AI tools, you'll need an OpenAI API key. Here’s how TechRay Apps recommends you get started.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Step-by-Step Guide to Getting an OpenAI API Key</h3>

      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Visit the OpenAI platform website at <a href="https://platform.openai.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">platform.openai.com</a>.</li>
        <li>If you don’t already have an account, sign up by following the easy steps provided on the site. You can also log in using your existing Google or Microsoft account.</li>
        <li>Once logged in, navigate to the top-right corner where your profile icon is located. Click on your name to reveal a dropdown menu and select the "View API keys" option.</li>
        <li>On the API keys page, find and click the "Create new secret key" button. A new API key will be generated. Make sure to copy and save it immediately, as you won’t be able to view it again after closing the window.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Is an OpenAI API Key Free?</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">Yes, you can obtain an OpenAI API key for free. When you sign up, you get $5 worth of free credit, valid for three months. After your free credits expire or are used up, you’ll need to add billing information to continue using the API. If you don’t, your account will remain active, but API requests will be disabled.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Rate Limits and Costs</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">OpenAI enforces rate limits based on your usage. These limits are defined by RPM (requests per minute) and TPM (tokens per minute). Depending on your usage and the specific AI models you choose (like GPT-4 or gpt-3.5-turbo), costs can vary. Detailed pricing information is available on OpenAI’s AI model pricing page, where you can compare the API's cost-effectiveness against other services like a ChatGPT Plus subscription.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Troubleshooting: Fixing "Incorrect API Key Provided"</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">If you encounter an error message indicating an "Incorrect API Key Provided," here are some troubleshooting tips:</p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Check for typographical errors: Ensure there are no typos or extra spaces in the API key.</li>
        <li>Confirm correct usage: Make sure the API key matches the organization or project you’re working on.</li>
        <li>Verify key status: Check if the API key has been deleted, deactivated, or cached incorrectly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Additional Troubleshooting Steps</h3>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Clear browser cache and cookies: If the issue persists, try clearing your browser’s cache and cookies before attempting again.</li>
        <li>API key formatting: Ensure your API key is formatted correctly by consulting the authentication page on OpenAI’s platform.</li>
        <li>Generate a new key: If all else fails, you can create a new API key following the steps outlined above.</li>
      </ul>
